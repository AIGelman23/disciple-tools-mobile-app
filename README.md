## Installation (Development)
* [Set up React Native (expo)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

`npm start`

Currently pure React Native, can be 'ejected' to integrate native code when the need arises.

## Installation (Demo)
To try out the app without setting up the development environment, download the "expo" app on iOS or Android:

[Expo Client (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779?mt=8)

[Expo Client (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US)

Then open the url https://exp.host/@joswin/DiscipleToolsApp to view within the expo app.
